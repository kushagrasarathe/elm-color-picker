module Evergreen.Migrate.V2 exposing (..)

{-| This migration file was automatically generated by the lamdera compiler.

It includes:

  - A migration for each of the 6 Lamdera core types that has changed
  - A function named `migrate_ModuleName_TypeName` for each changed/custom type

Expect to see:

  - `Unimplement–µd` values as placeholders wherever I was unable to figure out a clear migration path for you
  - `@NOTICE` comments for things you should know about, i.e. new custom type constructors that won't get any
    value mappings from the old type by default

You can edit this file however you wish! It won't be generated again.

See <https://dashboard.lamdera.app/docs/evergreen> for more info.
